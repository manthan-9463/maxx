# 7) How memory is managed in Python? 
=>
In Python, memory management is handled by an internal memory manager and an automatic garbage collector.

1. Memory Allocation: Python allocates memory for objects dynamically in the heap. The memory manager controls this allocation for efficient usage.
2. Garbage Collection: Pythonâ€™s garbage collector automatically frees memory for objects that are no longer in use. It uses *reference counting* and a *cyclic garbage collector* to detect and remove unused objects.

This system helps Python manage memory efficiently, ensuring resources are freed up as needed without requiring manual intervention from the programmer.

# 8) What is the purpose continuing statement in python?
=>
In Python, the continue statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. It is commonly used when you want to avoid executing the remaining code in a loop for a particular iteration based on a condition

# 17) What are negative indexes and why are they used? 
=>
Negative indexes in Python are used to access elements from the end of a sequence, such as a list, string, or tuple. Instead of starting from the beginning (index 0), negative indexes allow you to start counting from the last element of the sequence.

Convenience: They are helpful when you want to access elements from the end of a sequence without needing to know its length.
Readability: They make the code more concise and readable, especially when working with the last few elements of a sequence

# 25) What is List? How will you reverse a list?
=>
A list in Python is an ordered collection of items which can hold elements of different data types, such as integers, strings, and other objects. Lists are mutable, meaning their contents can be changed after they are created.

A list is defined by placing its elements inside square brackets [], and each element is separated by a comma.
Lists can hold heterogeneous data, which means you can store different data types in a single list.

-Reverse
There are several ways to reverse a list in Python. Here are some common methods:

1. Using the reverse() method (in-place reversal)
This method reverses the list in place and does not return a new list.
It modifies the original list.

2. Using slicing (creates a new reversed list)
This method creates a new list that is the reverse of the original one, leaving the original list unchanged.

3. Using the reversed() function (returns an iterator)
The reversed() function returns an iterator that can be converted into a list or used in a loop.

# 26) How will you remove last object from a list? 
=> 
1. Using the pop() method
The pop() method removes and returns the last element from the list. If no index is specified, it defaults to removing the last item

The pop() method not only removes the last element but also returns it, allowing you to capture or use the removed item.
If the list is empty and you call pop(), it will raise an IndexError

2. Using slicing
You can also use slicing to remove the last element of the list. This does not modify the list in place, but creates a new list without the last item.

This approach creates a new list that excludes the last item. The original list will be modified in the sense that it is now replaced with the new list.
The original list remains unchanged if slicing is used on a separate variable.

# 27) Suppose list1 is [2, 33, 222, 14, and 25], what is list1 [-1]? 
=>
In Python, negative indexing allows you to access elements from the end of a list. So, when you use list1[-1], it refers to the last element of the list.

Given that list1 = [2, 33, 222, 14, 25], hereâ€™s what happens:

list1[-1] will access the last element of the list, which is 25.


# 28) Differentiate between append () and extend () methods?
=>
The append() and extend() methods are both used to add elements to a list in Python, but they behave differently in terms of how they add elements.
Purpose: Adds a single element to the end of the list.
How it works: The element passed to append() is added as a single object, regardless of its type.
Syntax: list.append(element

Purpose: Adds each element from an iterable (e.g., list, tuple, string) to the end of the list individually.
How it works: The extend() method takes an iterable (like a list, tuple, or string) and adds each of its elements to the list.
Syntax: list.extend(iterable)

# 30) How will you compare two list?
=>
To compare two lists in Python:

1.Using ==: Compares both the order and elements of the lists.
2.Using !=: Checks if the lists are not equal.
3.Using is: Checks if both lists reference the same object in memory.
4.Using set(): Compares lists ignoring order and duplicates.
5.Using sorted(): Compares lists ignoring order, considering duplicates

# 43) )What is tuple? Difference between list and tuple. 
=>
A tuple is a built-in data structure in Python that can hold a collection of ordered, immutable items. Once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be modified, making it ideal for storing data that should remain constant.

Mutability	       Mutable (can be changed).	                         Immutable (cannot be changed).
Syntax	           Defined with square brackets []. 	                 Defined with parentheses ().
Performance	       Slower due to mutability.	                         Faster due to immutability.
Use Cases      	   Suitable for dynamic data.	                         Suitable for fixed/static data.
Methods	           Has more built-in methods (e.g., append, remove). 	 Fewer methods (e.g., count, index).
Memory Usage	   Consumes more memory.	                             Consumes less memory.

for key in sorted(my_dict):
    print(key, my_dict[key])
    
These methods allow you to efficiently access and process dictionary elements.


# 52) How Do You Check the Presence of a Key in A Dictionary?

To check the presence of a key in a Python dictionary, use these methods:

1. Using the in Keyword
my_dict = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25, "city": "New York"}

if "name" in my_dict:
    print("Key 'name' exists.")
2. Using the not in Keyword
if "gender" not in my_dict:
    print("Key 'gender' does not exist.")
3. Using the .get() Method
if my_dict.get("name") is not None:
    print("Key 'name' exists.")
These methods are efficient and avoid errors like KeyError.

# 65) How Many Basic Types of Functions Are Available in Python?  
=>
n Python, there are two basic types of functions:

1. Built-in Functions
These are functions provided by Python and are always available without the need to define them.
Examples:
print(): Prints a value.
len(): Returns the length of an object.
type(): Returns the type of an object.
input(): Gets user input.
sum(): Returns the sum of a sequence.
Python has over 70 built-in functions. You can find a full list here in the official Python documentation.

2. User-defined Functions
These are functions created by the user to perform specific tasks.

Defined using the def keyword.

Example:

python
Copy code
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("Alice"))  # Output: Hello, Alice!
Additional Categories of Functions:
While the basic classification is as above, user-defined functions can be further categorized based on how they handle inputs and outputs:

Functions with no arguments and no return value
Functions with arguments but no return value
Functions with arguments and return value
Functions with no arguments but return value
Summary
Basic types: Built-in and User-defined.
User-defined functions offer flexibility, while built-in functions cover common operations.

# 68) How can you get a random number in python?

n Python, you can use the random module to generate random numbers. Here are the most common ways to get random numbers:

1. Generate a Random Integer
Use random.randint(a, b) to generate a random integer between a and b (inclusive).
import random

# Generate a random integer between 1 and 10
random_integer = random.randint(1, 10)
print(f"Random Integer: {random_integer}")

2. Generate a Random Float
Use random.random() to generate a random float between 0.0 and 1.0.
import random

# Generate a random float between 0 and 1
random_float = random.random()
print(f"Random Float: {random_float}")

3. Generate a Random Float in a Specified Range
Use random.uniform(a, b) to generate a random float between a and b.
import random

# Generate a random float between 1.5 and 6.5
random_float_range = random.uniform(1.5, 6.5)
print(f"Random Float in Range: {random_float_range}")

4. Generate a Random Number from a Range
Use random.randrange(start, stop, step) to generate a random number from a range.import random

# Generate a random number from 0 to 9 (step 2)
random_range = random.randrange(0, 10, 2)
print(f"Random Number from Range: {random_range}")

5. Generate a Random Number from a Sequence
Use random.choice() to select a random item from a list, tuple, or range.import random

# Random number from a list
random_choice = random.choice([5, 10, 15, 20])
print(f"Random Choice: {random_choice}")

6. Generate Random Numbers with Gaussian Distribution
Use random.gauss(mu, sigma) to generate random numbers with a Gaussian distribution.import random

# Generate a random number with mean=0 and standard deviation=1
random_gaussian = random.gauss(0, 1)
print(f"Random Gaussian: {random_gaussian}")



.. code:: ipython3

    # 69) How will you set the starting value in generating random numbers?
    
    import random
    
    # Set the seed
    random.seed(42)
    
    # Generate random numbers
    print(random.randint(1, 10))  # Always the same for a given seed
    print(random.random())        # Always the same for a given seed

    import random
    
    # Example list
    my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    
    # Shuffle the list in place
    random.shuffle(my_list)
    
    print(f"Shuffled List: {my_list}")
    


.. parsed-literal::

    Shuffled List: [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]
    

# 71) What is File function in python? What are keywords to create and write file. 
=>
In Python, working with files is a common task, and it can be done using the built-in open() function. The open() function is used to open a file and returns a file object, which you can use to read from or write to the file.

File Functions in Python
open(): Used to open a file, either for reading, writing, or appending. This function returns a file object that can be used to interact with the file.
close(): Used to close a file after operations are done.
read(): Reads the entire content of a file.
readline(): Reads the file line by line.
write(): Writes content to a file.
writelines(): Writes a list of strings to a file.
Keywords for Creating and Writing to a File
When opening a file using open(), you need to specify the mode. The most commonly used modes for creating and writing to a file are:

'w': Open the file for writing. If the file exists, it will be overwritten; if it does not exist, a new file will be created.
'a': Open the file for appending. If the file exists, data is appended to it; if the file does not exist, it is created.
'x': Open the file for exclusive creation. If the file already exists, the operation will fail.

# 72) Write a Python program to read an entire text file. 
# =>
#     To read an entire text file in Python, you can use the open() function along with the read() method.
#     Here's a simple program that demonstrates how to read the entire contents of a file:

# Open the file in read mode
with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    # Read the entire file content
    content = file.read()

# Print the content of the file
print(content)


.. code:: ipython3

    # 73)  Write a Python program to append text to a file and display the text.
    
    # Define the text to append
    text_to_append = "This is the new text being appended to the file.\n"
    
    # Open the file in append mode
    with open('example.txt', 'a') as file:
        file.write(text_to_append)
    
    # Open the file in read mode to display the updated content
    with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
        content = file.read()
    
    # Display the updated content of the file
    print("Updated content of the file:")

# 83) Explain Exception handling? What is an Error in Python?

Exception Handling in Python
Exception handling is a mechanism in Python to gracefully handle runtime errors, allowing the program to continue execution or terminate in a controlled way. Instead of the program crashing when an error occurs, you can handle it using try, except, and optionally finally blocks.

Components of Exception Handling:
try block:

The code that might raise an exception is placed inside the try block.
except block:

The code that handles the exception is written in the except block. Different exceptions can be handled by using specific exception types.
else block (optional):

Executes if no exception occurs in the try block.
finally block (optional):

Executes regardless of whether an exception occurs or not, often used for cleanup.

What is an Error in Python?
In Python, an error is a problem in the program that causes it to stop executing. Errors are broadly categorized into two types:

Syntax Errors:

These occur when the Python parser detects incorrect syntax.
Example:
if True
    print("Hello")
(Missing colon in if statement will cause a syntax error.)
Exceptions:

These occur when a syntactically correct program tries to perform an operation that is not allowed.
Example:
print(10 / 0)
(This will raise a ZeroDivisionError.)
Common Types of Exceptions:
ZeroDivisionError: Division by zero.
ValueError: Invalid value for an operation.
TypeError: Operation applied to an object of an inappropriate type.
IndexError: Accessing an invalid index in a sequence.
KeyError: Accessing a non-existent key in a dictionary.
FileNotFoundError: Attempting to access a file that doesnâ€™t exist.
                                                                     

# 84) How many except statements can a try-except block have? Name Some built-in exception classes: 

A try block can have multiple except statements to handle different exceptions. Each except statement can handle a specific exception or a group of exceptions. Python will match the exception raised with the except blocks in the order they appear, and the first match is executed.
Some Built-In Exception Classes in Python
Hereâ€™s a list of commonly used built-in exception classes in Python:

BaseException (Parent class for all exceptions)
Exception (Base class for most exceptions derived from BaseException)
ArithmeticError (Base class for arithmetic errors)
ZeroDivisionError: Division or modulo by zero.
OverflowError: Numeric operation exceeds its limit.
FloatingPointError: Issues with floating-point operations.
AttributeError: Accessing an attribute that doesnâ€™t exist.
ImportError: Failure to import a module.
ModuleNotFoundError: A specific subclass of ImportError.
IndexError: Accessing an invalid index in a sequence (e.g., list, tuple).
KeyError: Accessing a non-existent key in a dictionary.
TypeError: Operation applied to an object of an inappropriate type.
ValueError: Operation receives a valid type but an invalid value.
FileNotFoundError: File operation requested on a non-existent file.
IOError: Input/output operation failure.
OSError: Errors related to the operating system.
NameError: Accessing a variable that is not defined.
UnboundLocalError: Referencing a local variable before assignment.
RuntimeError: Generic runtime error.
StopIteration: Raised by iterators to signal the end of iteration.
SyntaxError: Python syntax is invalid.
IndentationError: Incorrect indentation.
TabError: Mixing tabs and spaces.
MemoryError: Memory allocation failure.
RecursionError: Exceeding the maximum recursion depth.

# 85) When will the else part of try-except-else be executed? 

he else part of a try-except-else block is executed only if no exception occurs in the try block. If an exception is raised and caught by any of the except blocks, the else block will not be executed.

Flow of Execution:
try block: The code inside the try block is executed first.
except block: If an exception occurs in the try block, the corresponding except block is executed, and the else block is skipped.
else block: If no exception occurs in the try block, the else block is executed.
finally block (if present): The finally block is executed regardless of whether an exception occurred or not.


# 86) Can one block of except statements handle multiple exception?

Yes, a single except block can handle multiple exceptions in Python. 
This is done by specifying the exceptions in a tuple within the except block. 
If an exception occurs and matches any of the exceptions in the tuple, the corresponding except block will handle it.

In this example:

ValueError occurs if the input is not a valid integer.
ZeroDivisionError occurs if the user enters 0.

Key Points:
The exceptions in the tuple are treated as an OR condition, meaning the block will handle any of the specified exceptions.
The variable (e.g., as e) captures the exception object, which can be used to retrieve details about the error.

# 87) When is the finally block executed? 

The finally block in Python is executed regardless of whether an exception occurred or not in the try block. It is primarily used for cleanup actions, such as closing files, releasing resources, or other necessary final steps.

When Is the finally Block Executed?
No Exception Occurs:

If the code in the try block runs successfully without raising an exception, the finally block is executed after the try block completes.
Exception Is Raised and Handled:

If an exception occurs in the try block and is caught by an except block, the finally block is executed after the except block finishes.
Exception Is Raised but Not Handled:

If an exception occurs in the try block and is not caught by any except block, the finally block is still executed before the program terminates with the uncaught exception.
During return, break, or continue:

If a return, break, or continue statement is encountered in the try or except block, the finally block is executed before the control flow leaves the try block.

# 88) What happens when â€ž1â€Ÿ== 1 is executed?

When the expression "1" == 1 is executed in Python, it evaluates to False.

Why Does This Happen?
Data Type Mismatch:

"1" is a string, while 1 is an integer.
The == operator checks for both value and type.
Since the types differ (str vs int), Python evaluates the expression as False.
No Implicit Type Conversion:

Python does not automatically convert one data type to another when using ==.
It directly compares the operands' values and types.

    # 89) How Do You Handle Exceptions with Try/Except/Finally in Python? Explain with coding snippets. 
    
    #In Python, you can handle exceptions using the try, except, and finally blocks. This structure allows you to:
    
    # Write code that might raise an exception in the try block.
    # Handle specific exceptions or general exceptions in the except block(s).
    # Execute cleanup or mandatory actions in the finally block, regardless of whether an exception occurred.
    
    try:
        number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
        result = 10 / number
        print(f"Result: {result}")
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print("Error: You cannot divide by zero.")
    except ValueError:
        print("Error: Invalid input! Please enter an integer.")
    finally:
        print("Execution completed.")
